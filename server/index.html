    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    Users use many differnet services on the web to handle their day to day
    tasks, such as sharing images, editing documents and listening to music. 
    They expect their applications to work together seamlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is impossible for developers to intergrate with every external 
    service that their users prefer. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Web Intents solves this. Web Intents is a framework for client-side 
    inter-application communication. Services register their intention
    to be able to handle an action on the users behalf.  Applications
    request to start an Action of a certain verb (share, edit, view etc) and 
    the system will find the appropriate Services for the user to use based
    on the users preference.
    </p>
    <p>
    Web Intents puts the user in control of service integrations.
